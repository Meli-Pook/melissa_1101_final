            <p>1800s</p>
            <p>The foundation of computer science in the 1800s was marked by groundbreaking theoretical and mechanical innovations. Individuals, such as Babbage's and Lovelace's, ideas introduced key concepts like algorithms, programming, and automated computation which formed the basis of modern computer science.</p>

            <p>1900s</p>
            <p>In the 1900s, the development of early machines and hardware saw the rise of electromechanical devices, that were considered the first programmable and digital computers. In this era vacuum tubes replaced mechanical parts, enabling faster computations. Because of this era, we were able to lay the groundwork for modern computing hardware.</p>

            <h2> <a href="programming.html">Programming & Software Development</a></h2>
            <p>1940s-1960s</p>
            <p>Through the 1940s to the 1960s, programming and software development advanced with the creation of early programming languages such as Fortran, Assembly, and COBOL. Developers moved from manual machine code to higher level languages, this helped simplify coding and make computers more accessible. Compilers and operating systems emerged during this era which laid the foundation for modern software development.</p>

            <h2> <a href="microprocessor.html">Microprocessor & Personal Computing</a></h2>
            <p>1970s-1980s</p>
            <p>This era was revolutionary as it marked a rise of microprocessors. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s they made the microprocessors smaller and more affordable. The development of personal computers such as Apple II, IBM PC, and Commodore 64 started emerging as people were able to bring computers to their homes and businesses. This era also laid the foundation for modern computing with their innovations in operating systems and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).</p>
