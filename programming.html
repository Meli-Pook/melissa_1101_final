            <h2>The Beginning of Programming and Software Development</h2>
            <p>
                Between the 1940s and 1960s, programming and software development emerged as critical fields in computing. 
                The need for efficient communication with machines led to the development of programming languages 
                and new methods for designing software.

            <h2>Early Software Development</h2>
            <p>
                Initially, software was manually written in machine code, consisting of binary instructions understood by 
                the hardware. This process was labor-intensive and error-prone, spurring the need for higher-level programming tools.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Machine Code:</strong> The first generation of programming directly interacted with hardware, 
                    using binary instructions (0s and 1s).
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assembly Language:</strong> Introduced in the late 1940s, assembly language provided mnemonic 
                    codes for machine instructions, simplifying programming tasks.

                <li>
                    <strong>FORTRAN (1957):</strong> Created by IBM's John Backus, FORTRAN (Formula Translation) was the 
                    first widely used high-level programming language. It revolutionized scientific and engineering computations.

                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>COBOL (1959):</strong> Developed by Grace Hopper and others, COBOL (Common Business-Oriented 
                    Language) was designed for business and administrative purposes. It prioritized readability and real-world applications.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>LISP (1958):</strong> John McCarthy developed LISP, a language focused on artificial intelligence research, 
                    with features like recursion and symbolic processing.

                    <strong>Grace Hopper:</strong> Known as the "Mother of COBOL," Hopper was instrumental in creating 
                    the first compiler, which translated high-level code into machine code.

                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alan Turing:</strong> Turing introduced foundational concepts in algorithms and computation 
                    during the 1940s, influencing early programming practices.
