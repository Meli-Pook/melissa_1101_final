            <h2>The Hardware Revolution of the 1900s</h2>
            <p>
                The 20th century saw unprecedented advancements in computing hardware, transforming
                abstract theories into tangible, functioning machines. From the first mechanical calculators
                to the invention of electronic computers, this period marked the birth of modern computing.

                <li>
                    <strong>ENIAC (1945):</strong> The first general-purpose electronic computer, built by
                    John Presper Eckert and John Mauchly. It could perform complex calculations faster than
                    any previous device.

                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Colossus (1943):</strong> Used during World War II, this British computer was
                    designed to break encrypted German communications, playing a critical role in cryptography.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Zuse Z3 (1941):</strong> Designed by Konrad Zuse, this was the first programmable
                    digital computer, laying the foundation for software-driven machines.

                <li>
                    <strong>Vacuum Tubes:</strong> Used in early computers like the ENIAC, vacuum tubes allowed
                    electrical signals to be amplified or switched, enabling basic logic operations.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Punched Cards:</strong> Introduced by Herman Hollerith in the late 19th century and
                    widely used in the early 1900s, punched cards enabled data storage and processing.
                </li>
